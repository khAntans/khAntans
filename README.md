### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
## My name is Kristofers and I am a self-taught developer.
My interest in coding started in middle school when I made my first website, but I really fell in love with it in university, where I worked on creative projects like art installations and websites using 3d frameworks like three.js and a-frame and also helped others in realizing ideas that required some coding.
